# GeneratePrime
Generating Prime numbers within a given range, 100% test coverage.

I began the code test by implementing the provided default code and creating a few classes I knew I would need
to complete the project. From there I moved into my first unit test to build the prime number check method. After
each test added functionality I looked for chances to refactor my code, so it could be more flexible. In order to run 
this app just clone the repository and run the class GeneratorPrimeApp. It will first ask you to input the beginning 
range, and then ask you to input the ending range. Once it has accepted the ranges it will generate a print out of all
prime numbers within that range.
